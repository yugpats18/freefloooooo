# Driver Portal Implementation - Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. New Driver Role
- Added `driver` role to the system
- Drivers have limited access - only see their assigned trip
- Separate portal from admin dashboard

### 2. Automatic Account Creation
- When a trip is dispatched, a driver account is automatically created
- Username = Vehicle license plate (e.g., `ABC1234`)
- Password = Auto-generated 8-character random string
- Credentials shown to dispatcher in popup alert

### 3. Driver Portal Page
- New page: `/driver`
- Shows active trip details
- Google Maps navigation button
- Trip completion functionality
- Earnings display
- Trip timeline

### 4. Account Lifecycle Management
- Account created: When trip dispatched
- Account active: During trip
- Account deactivated: When trip completed
- Cannot be reused after deactivation

### 5. Enhanced Trip Management
- Added `driver_earnings` field to trips
- Dispatcher sees driver credentials after dispatch
- Driver can complete their own trip
- Automatic status updates for vehicle and driver

## Files Modified

### Backend:
1. `backend/src/migrations/schema.sql` - Added new columns
2. `backend/src/controllers/tripController.js` - Auto account creation logic
3. `backend/src/routes/index.js` - New driver endpoint
4. `frontend/src/utils/auth.js` - Added DRIVER role

### Frontend:
1. `frontend/src/pages/DriverPortal.jsx` - NEW driver-only page
2. `frontend/src/pages/Trips.jsx` - Show credentials, add earnings field
3. `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` - Role-based redirect
4. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Driver routing
5. `frontend/src/services/api.js` - New API method
6. `frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx` - Updated permissions

## Database Changes

### `users` table:
```sql
driver_id INTEGER - Links to drivers table
is_active BOOLEAN - Account active status
role - Added 'driver' to enum
```

### `trips` table:
```sql
driver_user_id INTEGER - Links to driver's user account
driver_earnings DECIMAL - Amount driver will receive
```

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **Dispatcher Creates Trip**
   - Fills in trip details
   - Includes driver earnings
   - Saves as "Draft"

2. **Dispatcher Dispatches Trip**
   - Clicks "Dispatch" button
   - System creates driver account:
     - Username: License plate
     - Password: Random 8 chars
   - Popup shows credentials
   - Vehicle → "On Trip"
   - Driver → "On Duty"

3. **Dispatcher Shares Credentials**
   - Sends username/password to driver
   - Via SMS, WhatsApp, or phone call

4. **Driver Logs In**
   - Uses license plate as username
   - Enters provided password
   - Redirected to driver portal

5. **Driver Views Trip**
   - Sees origin and destination
   - Views cargo weight
   - Checks earnings
   - Opens Google Maps for navigation

6. **Driver Completes Trip**
   - Arrives at destination
   - Clicks "Mark Trip as Complete"
   - Enters final odometer reading
   - Account automatically deactivated
   - Logged out

7. **System Updates**
   - Trip → "Completed"
   - Vehicle → "Available"
   - Driver → "Off Duty"
   - Driver account → Inactive

## Security Features

1. **Temporary Accounts**
   - Driver accounts are single-use
   - Automatically deactivated after trip
   - Cannot login again with same credentials

2. **Limited Access**
   - Drivers only see their own trip
   - No access to fleet data
   - No access to other drivers
   - No financial information

3. **Role-Based Routing**
   - Drivers cannot access admin pages
   - Automatic redirect to appropriate portal
   - Protected routes by role

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create trip as dispatcher
- [ ] Dispatch trip and note credentials
- [ ] Login as driver with credentials
- [ ] View driver portal
- [ ] Test Google Maps navigation
- [ ] Complete trip as driver
- [ ] Verify account deactivated
- [ ] Try to login again (should fail)
- [ ] Check vehicle status updated
- [ ] Check driver status updated

## Next Steps to Use

1. **Update Database** (see UPDATE_DATABASE.md)
2. **Restart Backend Server**
3. **Test with Dispatcher Account**
4. **Create and Dispatch a Trip**
5. **Test Driver Login**
